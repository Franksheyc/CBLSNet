# Fast-permutation-entropy
Efficiently computing values of permutation entropy from 1D time series in sliding windows

![Permutation entropy](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ValentinaUn/Fast-permutation-entropy/master/PE.png)

function outdata = PE( indata, delay, order, windowSize ) 

computes efficiently [1] values of permutation entropy [2] for orders=1...8 of ordinal patterns from 1D time series in sliding windows. See more ordinal-patterns based measures at www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/63782-ordinal-patterns-based-analysis--beta-version-


NOTES 

- Order of ordinal patterns is defined as in [1,3,7,8], i.e. order = n-1 for n defined as in [2] 

- The values of permutation entropy are normalised by log((order+1)!) so that they are from [0,1] as proposed in the original paper [2].


INPUT 

- indata - 1D time series (1 x N points) 
- delay - delay between points in ordinal patterns (delay = 1 means successive points) 
- order - order of the ordinal patterns (order + 1 is the number of points in ordinal patterns) 
- windowSize - size of sliding window ( = number of ordinal patterns within sliding window)


OUTPUT 

- outdata - (1 x (N - windowSize - order * delay) values of permutation entropy within [0,1] since each sliding window contains windowSize ordinal patterns but uses in fact (windowSize + order * delay + 1) points).


INTERPRETATION 

The larger the values of permutation entropy (in the range from 0 to 1) are, the higher diversity of ordinal patterns is and the more complex input data are.

EXAMPLE OF USE (with a plot): 

indata = rand( 1, 7777 ); % generate random data points 

for i = 4000:7000 % generate change of data complexity 

  indata( i ) = 4 * indata( i - 1 )*( 1 - indata( i - 1 ) ); 
  
end 

delay = 1; % delay 1 between points in ordinal patterns (successive points) 

order = 3; % order 3 of ordinal patterns (4-points ordinal patterns) 

windowSize = 512; % 512 ordinal patterns in one sliding window 

outdata = PE( indata, delay, order, windowSize ); 

figure; 

ax1 = subplot( 2, 1, 1 ); plot( indata, 'k', 'LineWidth', 0.2 ); 

grid on; title( 'Original time series' ); 

ax2 = subplot( 2, 1, 2 ); 

plot( length(indata) - length(outdata)+1:length(indata), outdata, 'k', 'LineWidth', 0.2 ); 

grid on; title( 'Values of permutation entropy' ); 

linkaxes( [ ax1, ax2 ], 'x' );


CHOICE OF ORDER OF ORDINAL PATTERNS 

The larger order of ordinal patterns is, the better permutation entropy estimates complexity of the underlying dynamical system [3]. But for time series of finite length too large order of ordinal patterns leads to an underestimation of the complexity because not all ordinal patterns representing the system can occur [3]. Therefore, for practical applications, orders = 3...7 are often used [2,4,5,8]. 
In [6] the following rule for choice of order is recommended: 
5*(order + 1)! < windowSize.


CHOICE OF SLIDING WINDOW LENGTH 

Window size should be chosen in such way that time series is stationary within the window (for example, for EEG analysis 2 seconds sliding windows are often used) so that distribution of ordinal patterns would not change within the window [2,8], [3,Section 2.2], [7,Section 5.1.2].


CHOICE OF DELAY BETWEEN POINTS IN ORDINAL PATTERNS 

I would recommend choosing different delays and comparing results (see, for example, [3, Section 2.2-2.4] and [7, Chapter 5] for more details) though delay = 1 is often used for practical applications. 
Choice of delay depends on particular data analysis you perform [3,4], on type of pre-processing and on sampling rate of the data. For example, if you are interested in low-frequency part of signals it makes sense to use larger delays.
